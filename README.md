# QRxFiltrate

QRxFiltrate is a Python-based tool that allows you to compress files, split them into blocks, and transform each block into a QR code. It also includes a script to reverse this process and reassemble the data from the QR codes.

## Introduction

QRxFiltrate is designed for scenarios where you need to exfiltrate data from an air-gapped computer or transfer data between devices without direct network connectivity. It provides a covert channel for transmitting files using QR codes, enabling you to split large files into smaller chunks and encode them as QR codes for transfer through visual means.

The tool consists of two scripts: `QRxFiltrate.py` and `reassemble.py`. The first script, `QRxFiltrate.py`, compresses a file, splits it into blocks, and converts each block into a QR code. The second script, `reassemble.py`, reverses this process and reassembles the data from the QR codes into the original file.

## Features

- File compression: QRxFiltrate compresses the input file to reduce its size before splitting it into blocks.
- Block splitting: The tool divides the file into smaller blocks based on the specified block size.
- QR code generation: Each block is transformed into a QR code image, which can be easily scanned and processed by QR code readers.
- Reassembly: The `reassemble.py` script can be used to reverse the process and reassemble the data from the QR codes into the original file.

## Installation

To use QRxFiltrate, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QRxFiltrate.git
   ```

2. Change into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd QRxFiltrate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. You're ready to use QRxFiltrate!

## Usage

The tool provides two scripts with different purposes. Here's how to use each of them:

### QRxFiltrate.py

```
usage: QRxFiltrate.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-s BLOCK_SIZE] filepath

File Splitter

positional arguments:
  filepath              path to the file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        output directory
  -s BLOCK_SIZE, --block-size BLOCK_SIZE
                        block size in bytes
```

- `filepath`: The path to the file you want to compress, split, and transform into QR codes.
- `-o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR`: (Optional) The output directory where the generated QR codes will be saved. If not specified, the default directory will be used.
- `-s BLOCK_SIZE, --block-size BLOCK_SIZE`: (Optional) The block size in bytes. This determines the size of each block into which the file will be split. If not specified, a default block size will be used.

### reassemble.py

```
usage: reassemble.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] directory_path

File Assembler

positional arguments:
  directory_path        path to the directory with the QR codes

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message

 and exit
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        output directory
```

- `directory_path`: The path to the directory containing the QR code images generated by the `QRxFiltrate.py` script.
- `-o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR`: (Optional) The output directory where the reassembled file will be saved. If not specified, the default directory will be used.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use QRxFiltrate:

1. Split a file into blocks and convert them into QR codes:

   ```bash
   python QRxFiltrate.py myfile.txt
   ```

   This will compress the file `myfile.txt`, split it into blocks using the default block size, and generate QR code images for each block.

2. Split a file into blocks, convert them into QR codes, and specify the output directory:

   ```bash
   python QRxFiltrate.py -o output/ myfile.txt
   ```

   This will perform the same process as the previous example but save the generated QR code images in the `output/` directory.

3. Reassemble a file from QR code images:

   ```bash
   python reassemble.py qr_codes/
   ```

   This will read the QR code images from the `qr_codes/` directory and reassemble the original file.
